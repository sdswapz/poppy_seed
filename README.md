![alt text](https://github.com/sdswapz/poppy_seed/blob/master/docs/images/logo.png)

## What is Poppy Seed?

Poppy Seed is an abstraction of malware analysis tool designed for Android OS platform. It provides static analysis capabilities to detect and analyze Android malware, with a focus on discovering security controls enforced by obfuscators, packers, and protectors.

## Why Poppy Seed?

According to Wikipedia, poppy seeds provide 'supposed magical powers of invisibility' - and who doesn't love invisibility, right? Including malware authors! But this Poppy Seed app will help you unveil the magic cloak around malware apps.

## Features

- **File Upload & Analysis**: Drag-and-drop interface for uploading Android APK files
- **Packer Detection**: Identifies 20+ Android protection schemes including:
  - DexProtector, ApkProtector, DexShield, SecNeo
  - Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba protection schemes
  - Bangcle, Jiagu, IJIAMI, and many others
- **Android File Parsing**: Supports APK, DEX, AXML, ARSC file analysis
- **Malware Repository**: Database for storing and browsing analyzed samples
- **Web Interface**: Django-based application with modern UI

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Django 4.2+

### Installation & Setup

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

1. **Install Docker**:
   - macOS: Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose`
   - Windows: Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. **Clone and run**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdswapz/poppy_seed.git
   cd poppy_seed
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Main Interface: http://localhost:8000/
   - All features available immediately

#### Option 2: Quick Setup Script

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdswapz/poppy_seed.git
   cd poppy_seed
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The setup script will automatically:
- Check Python 3 installation
- Install Django if needed
- Run database migrations
- Start the development server

#### Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdswapz/poppy_seed.git
   cd poppy_seed/Django
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt
   # OR
   pip3 install django
   ```

3. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

#### Access the Application

Once the server is running, access the application at:
- **Main Interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **Upload Page**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **About Page**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/
- **Repository**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/repo/
- **Admin Panel**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

### Usage

1. **Upload Files**: Use the drag-and-drop interface to upload Android APK files
2. **Analysis**: The system will automatically analyze the files for:
   - File type detection using magic bytes
   - Packer/protection scheme identification
   - Android manifest parsing
   - Resource file analysis
3. **Results**: View analysis results and browse the malware repository
